Introduction

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. In this project, we scrape an online clothing store located at https://books.toscrape.com to collect product information.
Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

    Python (3.x recommended)
    requests
    BeautifulSoup4
    pandas

You can install these libraries using pip:

bash

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas

Getting Started

    Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.

    bash

git clone <repository_url>

Navigate to the Project Directory: Change to the project directory.

bash

cd web-scraping-online-store

Run the Script: Execute the Python script to perform web scraping.

bash

    python web_scraper.py

How to Use

The web_scraper.py script is responsible for scraping the online clothing store. It starts by fetching the data from the first page and then proceeds to scrape all 50 pages, collecting information about titles, prices, ratings, availability, and images. The data is then stored in a Pandas DataFrame and saved to a CSV file (output.csv).

You can customize the script to save the data in other formats or modify the scraping logic as needed.
Example Output

The scraped data is saved in a CSV file named output.csv. Here's an example of the data structure:
